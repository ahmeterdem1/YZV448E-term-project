# YZV448E Term Project

Our task is to create a GDPR cleaner, a tool that detects personal information in text and 
removes or anonymizes it to comply with GDPR regulations. The base task is to create a NER
system that can identify personal information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses,
and other sensitive data. The advanced task is to implement the anonymization or removal of the detected
personal information.
